A Java based Offline GIFT editor
Paul Dunne
version 1, November 2012
Overview
GIFT
The GIFT file format is desribed in Wikipedia:
"The GIFT format allows someone to use a text editor to write multiple-choice, true-false, short answer, matching, missing word and numerical questions in a simple format that can be imported to a computer-based quizzes. It’s used in Moodle"
Moodle itself contains a simple editor to create moodle quizes. However, questions can only be added and modified online.
The formatting required for a GIFT question can be challenging to write (correctly). The following list outlines the types of questions that can be written in the GIFT format:
Types of Questions
True/False
Multiple Choice
Fill in the blank
Matching
Math range question
Math Range specified with interval end points
Multiple numeric answers with partial credit and feedback
Essay
Syntax
The syntax, relatively straight forward in most regards, presents difficulties to people because its relatively diffilcult to spot syntax errors. Here are some examples:
Example 1
// true/false
::Q1:: 1+1=2 {T}
Example 2
// multiple choice with specified feedback for right and wrong answers
::Q2::What's between orange and green in the spectrum?
{ =yellow # right; good! ~red # wrong, it's yellow ~blue # wrong, it's yellow }
Example 3
// multiple numeric answers with partial credit and feedback
::Q7:: When was Ulysses S. Grant born? {#
         =1822:0      # Correct! Full credit.
         =%50%1822:2  # He was born in 1822. Half credit for being close.
}
Details on this formatting can be read here: Moodles own Gift File Format documentation.The following website also has some information: Alterntive information
Offline Editing
Currently there are a very limited amount of editors for the GIFT format. The following are available.

Project Requirements
Using the Java programming language, an gift editor must be designed, and built, that allows a user to carry out certain tasks. The tasks are outlined here:
Tasks
Create individual questions (true/false, multiple choice etc)
Build a series of questions of a particular type. (e.g. 10 multiple-choice questions)
Save (or append) the questions to a new (existing) text file.
Some time must be spent of the design of the GUI. Included in the project folder are some screenshots of a prototype GUI for the assignment (with screen shots for True/False,Multiple Choice and Matching questions ).
